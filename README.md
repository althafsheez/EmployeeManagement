# Employee Management System (CRUD Application)

## Overview
This project is a full-stack **Employee Management System** that provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing employee records.  
The application is built using **Next.js** for the frontend and **Django** for the backend, following a clean separation of concerns between client and server.
